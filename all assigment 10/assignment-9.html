        <h1 id="CNC">Cloud Native Computing</h1>
        <p>The <strong>Cloud Native Computing </strong> program prepare the student to program in open source technologies like <strong><em>Linux, Docker, kubernative, Javescript, Nodes.js, React and React Native </em></strong>while introducing the student to development of microservices and software development techniques in cloud platform like AWS.</p>

        <h1 id="AI">Artificail Intelligence:</h1>
        <p>The artificial intelligence program of <abbr title="PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING">PIAIC </abbr>
        take the student through the foundation of Ai technology, via teaching programming in opn source language like <strong><em>Python, Numpy, Pandas,Tensorflow 20. and Flask,  </em></strong>and teaching deploying practice Ai solution and use cases , and ending with real-life example of modern day Ai in practice.
        
        
        </p>
    <h1 id="CHAIN">Blockchain</h1>
    <p>The main emphsise of <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is to understnd the blockchains like <strong><em>Etherem and Hyperledger(Fabric),</em></strong>
    and learn to program in language such as Solidity JavsScript on frameworks kike Node.js The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps),frameworks like web3 and Reyffle and an in-depth understanding of blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS)and how to develop and offer an initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
    </p>

    <h1 id="IOT">Internet Of Things:</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Internet of things </strong>program introduces the student to open source development technologies like <strong><em>Rust, Embedded Rust. WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetive </em></strong> while making them efficient in developing micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice Computingfor device control.</p>
